**Course Description**

Power exists in every workplace — in meetings, leadership roles, deadlines, and expectations — yet it’s rarely named or examined. When power goes unspoken, misunderstandings, burnout, and disengagement often follow.

In consensual BDSM spaces, power is never assumed. It is negotiated, communicated clearly, monitored continuously, and paired with responsibility and care. Over time, these same frameworks — consent, negotiation, trust, feedback, and aftercare — proved to be unexpectedly powerful tools in the corporate world as well.

This workshop explores how non-sexual principles from BDSM culture can be thoughtfully and ethically translated into professional environments. Participants will examine how consent-based communication, explicit boundaries, role clarity, and care-forward leadership can improve collaboration, accountability, and sustainability at work.

This is not about bringing kink into the workplace.
It is about learning how to recognize power, communicate with intention, and handle responsibility ethically — whether you’re managing people, projects, or yourself.
