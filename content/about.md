Ruff is an Atlanta-based pup, kink educator, and community builder with more than two decades of lived experience in kink, leather, and pup play. As the Former Rocky Mountain Leather Sir (2012), Ruff carries a deep respect for leather history, protocol, and tradition — while also embracing the evolution of kink toward more intentional, consent-forward, and emotionally aware forms of power exchange. His approach bridges old-guard leather values with modern conversations around communication, autonomy, and care, creating a style of leadership that is both rooted and responsive.

As a beta pup to his Alpha, Kuma, Ruff’s identity is shaped by service, curiosity, and emotional presence. He believes that submission is not about shrinking, but about showing up with intention — listening deeply, offering support, and remaining open to growth. Ruff’s pup style blends playful, curious energy with steady, grounded leadership, allowing him to meet people where they are while still holding space for learning, accountability, and exploration. Whether someone is brand new to pup play or deeply embedded in the community, Ruff works to create environments where pups feel safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and discover what authenticity looks like for them.

Education and mentorship sit at the heart of Ruff’s work. He is especially passionate about gear care, pup culture, and community sustainability, believing that taking care of our gear, our bodies, and each other is a form of respect — not just for ourselves, but for the communities we inhabit. Through workshops, pup teas, and events, Ruff focuses on making learning approachable, practical, and accessible, removing unnecessary gatekeeping while still honoring the depth and responsibility that kink carries.

Known for leading with empathy, humor, and honesty, Ruff teaches from lived experience rather than theory alone. He values conversations that are real, nuanced, and sometimes imperfect, and he believes that the strongest kink communities are built when knowledge is shared generously and connections are formed with intention, care, and mutual respect.

At his core, Ruff is simply a pup who believes that belonging is something we build together — through trust, clear communication, accountability, and the willingness to show up for our pack, again and again.
