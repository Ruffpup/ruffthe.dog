## Full Class Description

Mumification is about more than being wrapped up tight — it’s about **trust, surrender, sensation, and stillness**. In **Wrapped, Trapped, & Wagging: Mumification 101**, Ruff Pup guides you through the foundations of safe, intentional mumification play with a focus on **connection, control, and care**.

This beginner-friendly class is designed for curious pups, handlers, and kinksters who want to explore immobilization in a way that is **grounded, informed, and deeply satisfying** — whether your goal is sensory deprivation, headspace, helplessness, or calm containment.

### What We’ll Cover

#### Foundations & Safety First
- Consent, negotiation, and expectation setting
- Physical and psychological considerations
- Breathing, circulation, heat, and panic awareness
- When not to mummify someone

#### Materials & Methods
We’ll break down common mumification materials, including:

- **Vet Wrap**: breathable, flexible, pup-friendly, and great for beginners.
- **Plastic Wrap (Saran Wrap)**: smooth, tight, and excellent for compression and sensory isolation.
- **Tape (including duct tape)**: firm restraint, structural containment, and advanced control.

You’ll learn the benefits, limitations, risks, and ideal use cases for each — and how combining materials can change the experience.

#### Emergency Extraction & Safety Supplies
- Safety shears vs. knives (and why it matters)
- Where to cut and where never to cut
- Planning exits before you ever wrap
- Monitoring your sub while immobilized

#### Aftercare & Re-entry
- Supporting circulation, temperature, and grounding after release
- Emotional aftercare for deep surrender scenes
- Check-ins, cuddles, water, and decompression
- Helping your pup or sub feel safe, seen, and celebrated

### Ruff Pup’s Approach
This class is taught through a Ruff Pup lens: playful, embodied, consent-forward, and rooted in care. Mumification isn’t about pushing limits for shock value — it’s about intentional containment, shared trust, and letting someone fully let go.
