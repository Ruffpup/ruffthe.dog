**Course Description**

P## 🐾 Pup Play 101: #UnapologeticallyPuppy  
### More Than a Kink — A Way Back to Play

Pup play isn’t just about crawling, barking, or wearing gear.  
At its heart, pup play is about **permission**—permission to play, to rest, to be curious, to let go of performance, and to reconnect with a more instinctive, joyful version of yourself.

**Pup Play 101: #UnapologeticallyPuppy** is an introduction designed for the curious, the cautious, the experienced, and the quietly yearning. This class goes beyond *“what is pup play?”* and explores **why so many people find healing, connection, and grounding through pup headspace**.

### In this class, we’ll explore:
- 🐕 What pup play *really* is (and isn’t), beyond stereotypes  
- 🧠 How pup headspace works and why play is so powerful for stress relief and emotional regulation  
- 💛 The role of consent, communication, and care—both with others and with yourself  
- 🎾 How to access a playful mindset even without gear, scenes, or partners  
- 🌈 Identity, authenticity, and embracing your pup self without shame or apology  

Whether pup play shows up for you as kink, coping, community, or creativity, this class invites you to meet it with curiosity instead of judgment. You don’t need to “perform puppy” a certain way. There’s no one right energy, no hierarchy, no checklist.

This is an **affirming, consent-forward, and beginner-friendly space** where questions are welcome, exploration is encouraged, and being playful is treated as a strength—not a weakness.

Come curious.  
Come waggy.  
Come exactly as you are.
